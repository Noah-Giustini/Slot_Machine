Procedure to test the application:

1) If you are using Linux double click on runmeLNX. If you are using Windows double click on runmeWNDS
2) Ensure that there is currently no file in the application called savefile.txt, if this file exists delete it
3) Type y or yes into the GUI - the GUI application should start
4) There should be a starting screen with a single button (New Game) and a title screen. If there is a second button 
   (Saved Game), you either did not delete savefile.txt or there is a problem in the IOException handeling within the code.
   This problem in exception handeling is likely in the SavedGame class in gamelogic, however it could also be in the 
   way that the GUI handels IOExceptions

   One label should  "not held", and the other should display "Balance: $100".

   balance should increase. Otherwise, your balance should decrease by $10.

   balance should increase. Otherwise, your balance should decrease by $30.
9) Click on the "Hold Middle Reel" button. The label above the balance label should change to held.
10) Click on the "Bet $10" button again. The three slot machine symbols in the middle should not change. If you don't get
    three symbols in a row, than your balance should decrease by $20 instead of $10.

14) Click on any of the bet buttons. All slot machine symbols should change (the random nature of the slot machine
